## Automation using Scripts

### Why Use Scripts?

- Different programming languages available.
- Create repeatable processes.
- Consistent configuration and deployment.
- Built into most operating systems.
- Easier learning compared to a fully deployed automation platform.

### How Can Scripts Help?

- Quickly automate smaller tasks.
- Automate tasks that might not be feasible within a larger platform.
- Save time, effort, and increase productivity in managing infrastructure.

### Types of Scripts for IT Automation

1. **Task Execution**: A set of instructions or commands executed in a specific order within the environment.
2. **Configuration Modifications**: Useful for making configuration changes, even within the login process.
3. **Deployment**: Applicable to both on-premises and cloud services.

### Are Scripts IT Automation?

- Easy to create.
- Used to automate less complex tasks.
- Can use powerful coding languages and commands for many UI tasks.

**No**:
- Can be slow and time-consuming.
- Maintenance of scripts can be challenging.
- Scripts are part of an overall IT automation strategy.

## Scripting to Automate Windows

- Command Prompt and batch files.

     echo Document files older than 10 days deleted
     pause
     exit
     ```

4. **Rebooting and Shutting Down**:
